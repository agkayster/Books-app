    "summary": "Reading Eze Goes to School by Onuora Nzekwu and Michael Crowder, many years after class one, many things struck me.\r\n\r\nThis book, set in the 40s somewhere in Eastern Nigeria, had all the elements of the forces acting everywhere East of the Niger today.\r\n\r\nThe death of Okonkwo signified the death of that progressive force in Igbo land. In fact, the very nature of his death, which bothered on betrayal by kinsmen, captured the fundamental nature of the political paralysis facing Eastern states.",

    "summary": "The novel chronicles the life of Okonkwo, the leader of an Igbo community, from the events leading up to his banishment from the community for accidentally killing a clansman, through the seven years of his exile, to his return, and it addresses a particular problem of emergent Africa\u2014the intrusion in the 1890s of white missionaries and colonial government into tribal Igbo society. \r\n\r\nTraditionally structured, and peppered with Igbo proverbs, it describes the simultaneous disintegration of its protagonist Okonkwo and of his village. \r\n\r\nThe novel was praised for its intelligent and realistic treatment of tribal beliefs and of psychological disintegration coincident with social unraveling.",

    "summary": "The story details the cycle of life by chronicling the experiences of a young son and his mother throughout the course of the boy's life, and describing the exasperating behaviour exhibited by him throughout his youth. In spite of her occasional aggravation caused by her son's behaviour, the mother nonetheless visits his bedroom nightly to cradle him in her arms, and sing a brief lullaby promising to always love him. After her son enters adulthood and leaves home, his elderly mother occasionally sneaks into his bedroom at night to croon her customary lullaby. However she gradually grows old and frail, and her grown son visits his feeble, sickly mother for the final time. When he first arrives, his mother tries to sing her lullaby to him, but she is too weak to finish. He then cradles her in his arms and sings an altered rendition of her lullaby in reciprocation of the unconditional love that she had shown him throughout his life, vowing to always love her in return.",

Is it possible that the man she loved as a teenager\u2014and who professed to worship only her\u2014may be far different from what she has always believed?",
